Code Explanation

This comprehensive explanation details how the Hangman game project is structured and functions, highlighting the integration between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive word-guessing experience.

Project Overview

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word letter by letter. The project implements this game with a clean user interface, animations, and responsive design. When a player guesses incorrectly, the hangman image progresses toward completion. Players have six chances to guess the word correctly before losing.

HTML Structure

1. The document establishes a responsive foundation with proper meta tags and linked stylesheets, ensuring the game works across different devices.

2. The game modal section contains elements for displaying game-over or victory states, including a congratulatory or failure message and the option to play again.

3. The main container is divided into two key sections: the hangman-box displaying the visual hangman image and title, and the game-box containing the word display, hint text, incorrect guesses counter, and virtual keyboard.

4. The word display uses an unordered list (<ul>) that's dynamically populated by JavaScript to show the hidden word as underscores, revealing letters as players guess correctly.

CSS Styling

1. The layout employs flexbox to create a responsive, centered design that adapts to different screen sizes through media queries.

2. Animations enhance user experience throughout gameplay:
     o The .shake animation triggers when players make incorrect guesses, providing instant visual feedback.
     o The .bounce animation activates when letters are correctly guessed, drawing attention to newly revealed letters.
     o The modal uses a fade-in animation with a slight upward movement when displaying game results.

3. The keyboard is styled using a flex layout with responsive sizing to ensure consistent button spacing and appearance across devices.

4. Hover and active states on keyboard buttons provide visual feedback, with scale transformations creating a tactile feel to interactions.

JavaScript Functionality

1. Variable initialization creates the foundation for game state management:
     o DOM elements are selected and stored in variables for efficient access throughout the code.
     o Game state variables track the current word, correct letters, and wrong guess count.

2. The resetGame() function prepares for a new game by:
     o Clearing previous game state (incorrect guesses, correct letters).
     o Resetting the hangman image to its initial state.
     o Re-enabling all keyboard buttons and creating empty letter placeholders for the new word.

3. Word selection and hint display:
     o The getRandomWord() function selects a random word and hint from a predefined word list.
     o The original word is preserved for display purposes while gameplay uses a lowercase version to ensure case-insensitive matching.

4. Core gameplay logic in initGame():
     o Compares clicked letters against the current word.
     o For correct guesses, reveals the letter in all its positions within the word and applies the "guessed" class to trigger animations.
     o For incorrect guesses, increments the wrong guess counter and updates the hangman image accordingly.

5. The keyboard is generated programmatically:
     o A loop creates 26 button elements (a-z) using ASCII character codes.
     o Each button has an event listener that triggers the game logic when clicked.

6. Game completion is handled by the gameOver() function:
     o Determines if the player won or lost based on the passed parameter.
     o Displays an appropriate message and image in the modal.
     o Shows the correct word and provides an option to play again.

Key Gameplay Features

1. Dynamic Word Display: Letters are revealed individually when correctly guessed, maintaining the mystery of the word until fully solved or game over.

2. Visual Feedback System: Multiple animations provide immediate feedback on player actions:
     o The hangman image progressively changes with each incorrect guess.
     o The hangman shakes to emphasize incorrect guesses.
     o Correctly guessed letters bounce into place.

3. Responsive Interaction: All interactive elements provide visual feedback through hover and active states, creating a more engaging experience.

4. Adaptive Layout: The game interface seamlessly adjusts from desktop to mobile views, with particular attention to element sizing and spacing.

5. Game State Management: The code efficiently tracks and updates all aspects of the game state, from letter guesses to win/lose conditions.

The Hangman game project demonstrates effective integration of HTML structure, CSS animations, and JavaScript logic to create an engaging, interactive experience with clean code organization and responsive design principles.
